# GridContainer component

`<GridContainer />` holds groups of `<GridRow>` rows of `<GridChild>` columns.

You must wrap use one at the top level of your grid or else everything sort of blows up.

It has two config options:

- `snappy`, which means the grid will snap to the preconfigured `o-grid` breakpoints
- `bleed`, which removes exterior margins.
