# Analytics component

The analytics module won't display because it's mainly a behind-the-scenes thing.

You need to just simply import it where-ever.

<Preview>
  <Story name="Basic">
    <h4 key="1">You won&apos;t see anything here as &quot;Analytics&quot; has no visual output</h4>,
    <Analytics key="2" id={props.uuid} flags={props.flags} />,
  </Story>
</Preview>
