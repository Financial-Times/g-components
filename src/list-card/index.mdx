import { Meta, Story, Canvas } from '@storybook/blocks';
import * as IndexStories from './index.stories';

<Meta of={IndexStories} />

# ListCard component

This allows the creation of lists, much like the
deprecated "Latest Changes" Rich Journalism component.

You can provide an array as children:

<Canvas>
  <Story of={IndexStories.Examples} />
</Canvas>
