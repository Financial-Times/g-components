# Ads component

This component wraps [Origami's o-ads](https://github.com/Financial-Times/o-ads). The default props for `<Ad />` mimic the top ad.

Related files/configs for ads are also found in `useAds` in `shared/hooks.js` (sets lazy loading, for example).

There are several ad types:

### Generic ad

<Canvas>
  <Story of={IndexStories.GenericAd} />
</Canvas>

### Generic ad on slate

<Canvas>
  <Story of={IndexStories.GenericAdSlate} />
</Canvas>
