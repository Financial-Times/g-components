# Development

To test out components during development, from a repo generated by Starter Kit, run:

```bash
$ npm link ../g-components
```

# Releasing

Make sure your local is up to date with the origin, then update the docs if necessary:

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm run test -- -u
$ git add styles.css docs/*
$ git commit -m 'Update docs and snapshots'
$ git push
```

Work out the next version number (use `git tag -l`, here `v9.9.9` is an example), then release:

```bash
$ git tag v9.9.9
$ git push origin v9.9.9
```
