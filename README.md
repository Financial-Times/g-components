# `g-components`

Reusable React components for building IG pages.

## Adding to a project

There are two ways you can consume g-components:

1. The full bundle

```
import { Accordion } from "@financial-times/g-components";
import from "@financial-times/g-components/styles.css";
```

This is the new way. It's easier and about as performant as the old way.

2. Individual components

```
import Accordion from "@financial-times/g-components/accordion";
import from "@financial-times/g-components/styles.css";
```

If you're having performance issues, please try the old way of importing individual components.

## Migrating to g-components v9

g-components v9 is lighter than previous versions and has a few significant API differences:

1. You only need to import one CSS file regardless of whether you import individual components or the whole bundle:

```
import from "@financial-times/g-components/styles.css";
```

2. The following components have been removed:

- data-sonification
- feature
- html-head
- progress
- sticky-header
- sticky

Please stay on v8 if you use any of these components.

## Running the Storybook

You can see what components are available in Storybook:

```bash
$ npm run storybook
```

# Development

To test components during development:

```bash
$ npm link ../g-components
```

# Releasing

First make sure your local is up to date with the origin and that you're on the `main` branch:

```bash
$ git pull
$ git checkout main
```

Then update the snapshots:

```bash
$ npm run test -- -u
$ git add src/__snapshots__/*
$ git commit -m 'Update snapshots'
$ git push
```

Next, run `npm version [major|minor|patch]` to increment the version based on the type of changes in this release. We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) to increment versions:

- Breaking (non-backwards-compatible) changes should be a `major` release
- New features (that are backwards-compatible) should be `minor`
- Bug fixes should be a `patch`
- Alternatively, you can use `npm version vX.X.X` to set the version yourself.

Finally, run `git push --follow-tags` to push the new version to GitHub, which will trigger the CircleCI pipeline that publishes the new version on NPM.

### Pre-release ("canary") versions

If you'd like to release a pre-release version (e.g. to test or gradually roll out a new feature), you can create a new version like `npm version v1.0.0-canary.0`. The version number should represent the ultimate release this change will land in, while the final `0` can be incremented to make subsequent prerelease builds.

NPM can also generate this automatically for you, with `npm version pre[major|minor|patch] --preid canary`.
